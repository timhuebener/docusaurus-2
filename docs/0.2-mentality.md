Learning to code is incredibly rewarding but can also be difficult and frustrating. Like any skill worth knowing, it takes time to acquire, and it can’t be learned in a weekend or even a month. 

However, **you don't need a to be a math wizard or a genius in any way to learn web development**. 

The most import part (as with any other skill) is that you **have the right mindset** you spend a little time each day improving your skills.

Your mindset is very important when teaching yourself any new skills, not just programming. Your mindset will have more of an impact on your chances of success than just about anything else.

Someone with the **fixed mindset** believes if they don’t get something on their first attempt, they never will. 
They believe that they simply aren’t smart enough to be able to do or understand some things.

However, there is a wide body of research showing that intelligence is not fixed but can instead be developed. 
Someone with the **growth mindset** believes they can get better at anything with effort and persistence.

I personally learned the hard way how the growth mindset works. When starting my computer science degree I didn't know anything about programming. 

Which lead to me immediately failing the programming course in my first semester. But a year later after continuing to learn programming I aced the course in my second attempt. 

So lets finally get started!
